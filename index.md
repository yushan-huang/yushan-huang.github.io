I am Yushan Huang, currently a PhD Student at Imperial College London - [NetSys Lab](https://netsys.doc.ic.ac.uk/index.html) at London, supervised by [Prof. Hamed Haddadi](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/h.haddadi) and [Prof. Payam Barnaghi](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.barnaghi). I have a Master of Mechanical Engineering in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. Jihong Chen, and a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering in Shandong University.

My current research focuses on Low-Energy Adaptive Machine Learning System at the Edge, helping users achieving low energy personalization, compressing and adapting the model to edge/mobile/ultra-low-power devices. My previous research focuses on applying ML models on CNC machine tools. I also have many experiences in CAD/CAM/CNC disign, C/C++ development, Usability Evaluation and Test, Prototype Develop and Evaluation, etc. I enjoy working in interdisciplinary fields and love ''beautiful'' things in both science, music, and humanities.
